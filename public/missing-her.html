                    <p class="missing-you-intro">The past two days without you have felt like a pause button was pressed on everything warm and happy in my life. I couldn't see you, couldn't talk to you… and honestly, it felt like something big was missing from my world. <span class="floating-heart">💔</span></p>
                    
                    <p class="missing-you-paragraph">I missed you—a <span class="emphasis-word">lot</span>. <span class="floating-heart">💗</span><br>
                    I missed your voice, your random scoldings, your little bursts of drama, and that beautiful calm you bring into my chaos.</p>
                    
                    <p class="missing-you-paragraph">Even your anger—yes, even that—I missed. Because behind that fire is a heart that cares for me more than anything. And I felt the absence of that love so deeply these past two days. <span class="floating-heart">💖</span></p>
                    
                    <p class="missing-you-paragraph">Everything reminded me of you—your laugh echoing in my head, your smile flashing in my mind, your love hugging me in silence. I even caught myself thinking, "If she were here, she'd tease me for this," or "She'd be making that cute annoyed face right now." <span class="floating-heart">😊</span></p>
                    
                    <p class="missing-you-paragraph">No matter how busy or distracted I tried to be, every corner of my thoughts led back to you. <span class="floating-heart">🔄</span></p>
                    
                    <p class="missing-you-paragraph">I know sometimes life gets in the way—but please know this: whether I get to talk to you or not, you're always with me. In my heart. In my thoughts. In the little habits I picked up because of you. <span class="floating-heart">💭</span></p>
                    
                    <p class="missing-you-paragraph">I miss you so much, soda buddi. I can't wait to see you, hug you, and hear you say "pagal" like everything is okay again. <span class="floating-heart">🤗</span></p>

                <p class="convincing-paragraph">You're fighting with me, but you're still doing it like a baby. And somehow, even in the middle of all this, you're still the cutest thing ever. I swear, only you can make being angry look adorable. <span class="floating-heart">🥺</span></p>
                
                <p class="convincing-paragraph">I know I messed up somewhere — maybe I said something wrong, maybe I didn't understand your feelings at the right time.

                <p class="convincing-paragraph">You mean so much to me, jaan. More than I can ever explain in words. You're not just "my person" — you're my best friend, my safe place, my reason to smile after a tiring day. And not being okay with you? It's like the whole world goes dull. <span class="floating-heart">✨</span></p>
                
                <p class="convincing-paragraph">I miss you. I miss your voice, your random rants, your silly jokes, even your scolding. I miss us. <span class="floating-heart">💭</span></p>
                
                <p class="convincing-paragraph">I know you're hurt, and I won't rush you. But I'm here… always, with all my love, all my patience, and open arms. Ready to listen. Ready to fix. Ready to love you even harder. <span class="floating-heart">🤗</span></p>
                
                <p class="convincing-paragraph">Please don't stay upset for too long. This pagal of yours is waiting — for your smile, your laugh, and that little "I forgive you, idiot" look you always give. <span class="floating-heart">😊</span></p>
