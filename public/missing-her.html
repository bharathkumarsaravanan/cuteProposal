                    <p class="missing-you-intro">The past two days without you have felt like a pause button was pressed on everything warm and happy in my life. I couldn't see you, couldn't talk to you… and honestly, it felt like something big was missing from my world. <span class="floating-heart">💔</span></p>
                    
                    <p class="missing-you-paragraph">I missed you—a <span class="emphasis-word">lot</span>. <span class="floating-heart">💗</span><br>
                    I missed your voice, your random scoldings, your little bursts of drama, and that beautiful calm you bring into my chaos.</p>
                    
                    <p class="missing-you-paragraph">Even your anger—yes, even that—I missed. Because behind that fire is a heart that cares for me more than anything. And I felt the absence of that love so deeply these past two days. <span class="floating-heart">💖</span></p>
                    
                    <p class="missing-you-paragraph">Everything reminded me of you—your laugh echoing in my head, your smile flashing in my mind, your love hugging me in silence. I even caught myself thinking, "If she were here, she'd tease me for this," or "She'd be making that cute annoyed face right now." <span class="floating-heart">😊</span></p>
                    
                    <p class="missing-you-paragraph">No matter how busy or distracted I tried to be, every corner of my thoughts led back to you. <span class="floating-heart">🔄</span></p>
                    
                    <p class="missing-you-paragraph">I know sometimes life gets in the way—but please know this: whether I get to talk to you or not, you're always with me. In my heart. In my thoughts. In the little habits I picked up because of you. <span class="floating-heart">💭</span></p>
                    
                    <p class="missing-you-paragraph">I miss you so much, soda buddi. I can't wait to see you, hug you, and hear you say "pagal" like everything is okay again. <span class="floating-heart">🤗</span></p>
