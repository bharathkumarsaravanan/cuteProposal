Honestly, if staring was a crime, I'd be doing life in jail by now. <span class="floating-emoji">👀</span> That smile, that little shy expression you gave me when I looked at you like a pagal—it's stuck in my head like my favorite song. And trust me, it's on repeat. <span class="floating-emoji">🎵</span></p>
                        
                        <p class="cutie-paragraph">I didn't even realize how much I needed that time with you until I had it. You being around makes everything better. Even the silence feels perfect when it's with you. And now today… feels so quiet again. Like something's missing. Like you. <span class="floating-emoji">💭</span></p>
